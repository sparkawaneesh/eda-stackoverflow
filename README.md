## ‚ú® Abstract

This analysis explores the 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, covering over 65,000 responses. Using Python-based tools, we aim to extract key insights about global developer trends, professional experiences, and industry shifts.

---

## üß© Introduction

The **Stack Overflow Developer Survey** serves as an annual benchmark for the developer community worldwide, offering rich insights into skills, technologies, work conditions, and education trends. This EDA focuses on interpreting and visualizing these trends to better understand the developer landscape.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

**Tools Used:**
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- Seaborn

**Process Overview:**
- Load dataset
- Handle missing values
- Clean and preprocess data
- Group and analyze data across dimensions like age, country, salary, and tech stacks

**Focus Areas:**
- Developer demographics
- Popular technologies
- Salary distributions
- Work arrangements and job satisfaction

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Map global developer distribution by age and country
- Identify most-used programming languages and tools
- Analyze salary variations by region and education level
- Explore trends in remote work and employment types
- Examine developer job satisfaction and burnout levels

---

## üìä Results and Analysis

- **Demographics:** Majority aged between 25‚Äì34; top countries include USA, India, and Germany.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, JavaScript, and SQL remain dominant; Rust and TypeScript show notable growth.
- **Salaries:** Highest in the U.S. and Western Europe; significant salary gaps across regions.
- **Work Environment:** Preference for remote or hybrid work models; full-time roles dominate.
- **Education:** Developers are a mix of self-taught professionals and those with formal bachelor's degrees.
- **Satisfaction:** Generally high, but issues like burnout and work-life balance concerns persist.
